# Password Generator
This application will provide two random passwords per your specifications.  

## Description

If you don't trust big company's to provide unique random passowrds, then this is the program for you.  If you combine this with my Passman application built in Java, then you will never forget a password again.  Your accounts will never be hacked.  This program makes creating a unique, random password effortless.
